  <p><b>Lateral surface area of cuboid: </b><br />
    The sum of surface areas of all sides except top and bottom face
     of solid is defined as lateral surface area of a solid.
    Consider a Cuboid of length,breadth and height to be l, b and h respectively.<br />
    <img src = "assets/imgs/cuboid2.png" /><br />
    <b>>Lateral surface area of the cuboid</b><br />
    = Area of face ADHE + Area of face BCGF + Area of face ABFE + Area of face DCGH<br />
    
    =2(b × h) + 2(l × h) <br />
    
    =2h(l + b)<br />
    <b>Surface area of a cuboid: </b><br />
    The surface area of a cuboid is equal to the sum of the areas of its six rectangular faces.

Consider a cuboid having length is ‘l’ cm, breadth is ‘b’ cm and height ‘h’ cm.<br>

Area of face EFGH = Area of Face ABCD =<br />
 (l x b)cm²<br />

Area of face BFGC = Area of face AEHD = <br />
(b x h)cm²<br />
Area of face DHGC = Area of face ABFE = <br />
(l x h)cm²<br />
Total surface area of a cuboid = Sum of the areas of all its 6 rectangular faces<br />

= 2(l × b) + 2(b × h) +2(l × h)<br />

= 2(lb + bh +lh)<br />
  </p>
  <p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
     Find the total surface area of cuboid with dimensions 2cm by 3cm by 7cm.
<br />
    <b>Solution</b ><br />
      Total Surface Area(TSA) = 2 (lb + bh + hl )<br />
      
      TSA = 2 ( 2*3 + 3*7 + 7*2 ) <br />
      
      TSA = 2 ( 6 + 21 + 14 )<br />
      
      TSA = 82cm²<br />
      
      So, the total surface area of this cuboid is 82cm²<br /><br />
      
     <b> Example 2:</b> The length, width and height of a cuboid are 12 cm, 
      13 cm and 15 cm respectively. Find the lateral surface area of a cuboid.<br />
      
      <b>Solution:</b> <br />
      
      Lateral surface area of a cuboid is given by: <br />
      
      LSA = 2h ( l + w ) <br />
      
      Insert the values into the formula,<br />
      
      LSA = 2*15 ( 12 + 13 ) <br />
      
      LSA = 750cm² <br >
