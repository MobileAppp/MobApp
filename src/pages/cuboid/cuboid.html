  <p>A cuboid is a closed 3-dimensional geometrical figure
     bounded by six rectangular plane regions.</p>
     <img src = "assets/imgs/cuboid3.png" />
     <p><b>Faces</b><br />Cuboid is made up of six rectangles and each of the rectangle is called the face. In the figure above, ABFE, DAEH, DCGH, CBFG, ABCD and EFGH are the 6-faces of cuboid. The top face ABCD and bottom face EFGH form a pair of opposite faces. 
       Similarly, ABFE, DCGH, and DAEH, CBFG are pairs of opposite faces.
        Any two faces other than the opposite faces are called adjacent faces.
        Here, adjacent faces are ABCD, ABFE and ABCD, AEHD.</p>
      <p><b>Base and lateral faces:</b>
        Any face of a cuboid may be called as the base of the cuboid. The four faces which meet the base are called the lateral faces of the cuboid.
       In Figure (1) above, EFGH represents the base of a cuboid.</p>
       <p><b>Edges: </b><br />The edge of the cuboid is a line segment between any two adjacent vertices.
          There are 12 edges, they are AB,AD,AE,HD,HE,HG,GF,GC,FE,FB,EF
           and CD and the opposite sides of a rectangle are equal.
          Hence, AB=CD=GH=EF,AE=DH=BF=CG and EH=FG=AD=BC.</p>
          <p><b>Vertics</b><br />The point of intersection of the 3 edges of a cuboid is called vertex of a cuboid.
A cuboid has 8 vertices A,B,C,D,E,F, G and H represents vertices of cuboid in fig 1.
By observation, the twelve edges of a cuboid can be grouped into three groups such that all edges in one group are equal in length so
there are three distinct groups and the groups are named as length, breadth and height.</p><br />
